# Hollow X Hollow
This is an implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the theme of one of my favourite video games, Hollow Knight. The game is designed to be suitable for implementation into my soon to be gaming social media site. It has been developed with a focus on alogorithm implimentation, Javascript learning, animation and responsiveness. In the game there are various game modes present:
- **PVP:**  Player vs player where you place the slections for both parties
- **Easy:** Computer makes random moves with no regard for where it places them
- **Standard:** Computer check if there is a winning position after every move is made and tries to capitalise on it
- **Impossible:** Computer is using the minmax algorithm to determine the best possible course of action making it impossible to win against it, I made a boss battle sequence that gives you the oppertunity to beat the boss if you draw 2 times against it in a row.
