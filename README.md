# PlayLink - Portfolio Application

Welcome to PlayLink, a vibrant social media platform designed for sharing, connecting, gaming and engaging with the community.

This application was developed and designed by me, Jaka Ambrus over multiple months to further my knowledge and skills in full-stack web development.

My application contains authentication, authorization, personalized profiles, a dynamic posts feed, gaming, live chat and more. Prioritizing both frontend and backend optimization, I focused on performance and best practices to enhance user experience and interface design, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly environment.
